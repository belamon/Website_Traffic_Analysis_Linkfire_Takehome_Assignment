Website Traffic Analytics

This data project was originally used as a take-home assignment during the recruitment process for Data Science positions at Linkfire. The dataset is publicly available on StrataScratch:

The objective of this project is to analyze user traffic, understand the distribution of events, and propose ideas to improve link click-through rates. SQL is used to answer the following analytical questions:
	1.	How many total pageview events did the links in the dataset receive over the full period, and how many per day?
	2.	How many events occurred for the other recorded event types?
	3.	Which countries generated the pageviews?
	4.	What is the overall click rate (clicks/pageviews)?

The dataset (traffic.csv) contains web traffic event logs collected over a 7-day period. Each record represents an event on a specific link, along with categorical attributes such as country, city, artist, album, track, and ISRC.
